#Transforming Waste into Wealth: Sustainable Recycling of Used Tractor Tyres in Kenya’s Jua Kali Industry Overview
This project focuses on addressing the environmental and economic challenges posed by the disposal of used tractor tyres in Kenya. It proposes a sustainable recycling framework leveraging the innovation and resourcefulness of Kenya's Jua Kali sector. The initiative aims to repurpose discarded tyres into marketable products such as furniture, shoe soles, and construction materials. This effort will reduce pollution, promote circular economy principles, and create inclusive job opportunities within the informal sector.
Key Goals:
•	Environmental Impact: Reduce pollution by recycling used tractor tyres.
•	Economic Empowerment: Create job opportunities and stimulate economic growth within the Jua Kali sector.
•	Sustainable Development: Contribute to SDGs 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production) and 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth).

Background
Kenya faces significant challenges related to waste management, particularly with the disposal of used tractor tyres. Traditional disposal methods such as burning or illegal dumping release toxic substances into the environment. The Jua Kali sector, known for its resourcefulness, presents a unique opportunity to address this issue by converting waste into valuable products.

Problem Statement
Despite progress in recycling plastics and metals, rubber waste—especially tractor tyres—remains largely unaddressed. The improper disposal of these tyres contributes to environmental degradation and health risks, including the spread of diseases like malaria. The Jua Kali sector's ability to repurpose waste is hindered by a lack of training, financial support, and policy backing.

Objectives
General Objective:
To develop a sustainable tyre recycling framework within Kenya’s Jua Kali sector that transforms discarded tractor tyres into marketable products.
Specific Objectives:
1.	Collection & Sorting: Develop an efficient tyre collection and sorting system.
2.	Skill Development: Provide structured training for Jua Kali artisans in advanced tyre recycling techniques.
3.	Pollution Mitigation: Reduce environmental pollution through effective tyre recycling.
4.	Economic Empowerment: Create job opportunities within the informal sector.
5.	Market Expansion: Improve accessibility to recycled tyre products in local and international markets.

Methodology
This study will adopt a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative research to gather comprehensive data on tyre waste management and recycling in Kenya.
Data Collection:
•	Field Surveys & Interviews: Engage local stakeholders (farmers, workshop owners, and artisans) to understand tyre disposal practices and challenges.
•	Experimental Trials: Pilot different recycling methods in collaboration with local universities.
•	Market Analysis: Assess demand for recycled tyre products.
Data Analysis:
•	Quantitative Analysis: Use statistical tools to analyze tyre waste volumes, employment metrics, and product sales.
•	Qualitative Analysis: Conduct thematic analysis of survey and interview responses.

Global Insights
African Innovations:
Research in Africa has shown that mechanical transformation techniques, like crushing and compaction, can turn tyres into construction materials, providing cost savings and environmental benefits.
European Models:
The European Union’s Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies have successfully reduced tyre waste through systematic recycling frameworks, serving as a potential model for Kenya.
Swiss Technology:
Swiss innovations in tyre recycling, including advanced machinery and robust policy support, could help Kenya scale up its recycling efforts, improving both efficiency and market competitiveness.

Expected Outcomes
1.	Environmental Impact Reduction: Reduced pollution due to improved tyre disposal and recycling practices.
2.	Economic Empowerment: Creation of jobs and enhanced income for Jua Kali artisans.
3.	Technological Advancement: Integration of cost-effective recycling technologies.
4.	Policy Influence: Stronger local waste management policies and increased community awareness.
5.	Market Growth: Improved local and international market penetration for recycled tyre products
